User Story:

AS A...traveler in 2020 (in a COVID-less alternate reality)
I WANT...to easily check the weather and forecast of my destination, find nearby restaurants, and translate English into my destination’s language
SO THAT...one’s traveling experience is streamlined and can spend less time searching and more time discovering.
